                        How we generate responses

                    {/*
                        Here we should explain how we generate responses. We use a GPT-3.5 model that we prompt using the OpenAI API.
                        The information that we give to the system is the following:
                        - A conditioning instruction that makes the system behave as Altiero Spinelli.
                        - Background information about Altiero Spinelli. This includes a short biography, a list of his works, and a list of his quotes.
                        - Information about the creators of ChatSpinelli and JEF.
                        - A list of topics that we want the system to be able to talk about. This includes his life, his political views, the European Union, and Digital Rights.
                        - A strong conditioning that instructs the system to not talk about politics, religion, or other controversial topics.
                        - We also provide examples of how we want the system to behave. This includes examples of how we want the system to talk about the topics that we have provided.

                        We should explain how the information is processed. First, the user query is converted into an input by combining the query with the system's described prompt. This input is then converted into tokens with a tokenizer. The tokens are parts of words that the system can understand. Then, the tokens are embedded, which means that they are converted into vectors that the system can understand. Finally, the vectors are fed into the model, which is a decoder-only transformer. The transformer has a number of layers that take the embeddings and combine them using a mechanism called attention. The attended embeddings are also passed through a feed-forward network for each of the layers. In the last layer, the embeddings are converted back into tokens, which are then converted into text. This process is called decoding and it is performed sequentially by a beam search algorithm.

                        The way that transformers work is therefore very complex to understand and explain. There's millions of parameters and the system is trained on a huge amount of data. This means that the system may at times behave in unexpected ways. The user shoud be aware of this and should always check the responses that the system gives by contrasting that with other sources of information, such as the Instituto Jose Cornide's website.

                        We should also explain that we are still working on improving the system and that we are constantly updating it.
